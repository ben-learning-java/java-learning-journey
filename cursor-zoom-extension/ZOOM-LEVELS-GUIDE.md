# 🔍 Multi-Level Zoom Guide

## How It Works Now:

### Progressive Zoom:
1. **First press** → Zooms to **2x**
2. **Second press** → Zooms to **3x**
3. **Third press** → Zooms to **4x** (MAX)
4. **Fourth press** → Resets to normal (1x)

### Double-Tap to Zoom Out:
- Press the shortcut **twice quickly** (within 0.4 seconds)
- Instantly zooms out to normal no matter what level you're at

### Visual Feedback:
- A **red circle** appears at your cursor showing the zoom level
- Text inside shows: **"2x"**, **"3x"**, **"4x"**, **"OUT"**, or **"RESET"**

## Examples:

### Scenario 1: Reading Small Text
```
1. Move cursor to the text
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z → See "2x" indicator
3. Still too small? Press again → See "3x" indicator
4. Perfect! Keep reading
5. Done? Double-tap quickly → See "OUT" indicator
```

### Scenario 2: Looking at an Image
```
1. Move cursor to the image detail
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z → Zooms to 2x
3. Press again → Zooms to 3x
4. Press again → Zooms to 4x (maximum)
5. Press again → Resets to normal (see "RESET")
```

### Scenario 3: Quick Zoom In/Out
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Z → Zooms to 2x
2. Immediately press again (within 0.4 sec) → Zooms out (double-tap detected)
```

## Tips:

- **Wait between presses** (> 0.4 sec) to increase zoom level
- **Press quickly twice** (< 0.4 sec) to zoom out instantly
- The zoom always centers on your **current cursor position**
- You can move your cursor to a new spot and zoom there
- Maximum zoom is **4x** - after that it resets to normal

## Keyboard Shortcut:
- **Windows/Linux**: Ctrl+Shift+Z
- **Mac**: Command+Shift+Z

```java
// Data types
int number = 42;
double decimal = 3.14;
String text = "Hello";
boolean flag = true;

// Control structures
if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // loop code
}

while (condition) {
    // loop code
}

// Method definition
public static returnType methodName(parameters) {
    // method body
    return value; // if not void
}
```
